# Welcome! Here you're at the home page for Mind Builders

This page is created by Arjun/Komefumi. I made I'm happy to have you here. The fact that you've ended up here might mean you're trying to build your life, and you may be having difficulties that other people might not be able to relate well to.

There are people with diverse and niche problems that might not be alleviated so easily and with information that's available on the internet.

It can be worse if you're alienated in real life, and even online.

Even worse when you're feeling worthless.

What's important is that you try. And know that as long as you are reading this, you have an opportunity at each moment to turn your life around.

The time spent on one thing can't be altered; but each thing, even perceived mistakes, could become stepping stones to a future that you are yet to define - or perhaps even defining at this moment.

No experience is lacking worth. You need to believe in yourself and in the possibility of a future that would have you look back at all the things that happened, and all the mistakes, as being necessary to have reached where you would like to reach.

Now, this isn't to say you have to justify anything that you feel guilty for. But you can take responsibility to ensure such things don't happen again, either for you or others - and the reach that you can aim for, is entirely up to you.

## But what if I'm facing great challenges?

You have to decide on what's important to you, and what you can do each moment that has meaning. If you have a skill you would like to utilize, I would urge you to not wait until you are a 'master'. Don't delay yourself. Do what you can, with what you have, and if what you create or endeavor doesn't look good compared to what others make, it's okay.

Now, depending on what you would like to do, I would urge you to take precautions. Nothing that might have the risk of damaging your health when done improperly, would be encouraged by me to be performed until you are truly ready.

## But my mental health is in the way.

There's an idea that our mental health issues could be stepping stones as well. There's a possibility that what we have as issues could in fact be the basis for certain skills and capabilities that others might not easily possess. Abstract ones even, and what's true and permanent is build through time and effort.
So take the time. Recover. What you will uncover might be something that others might not have.

Think of it this way. There is something... and that something has one of it's poles as your present problems. The other pole, is something like a boon. A gift, a capability. A talent (if you would like to use that word) - something others might not have, just the same as your issues.

So, what is it that you should do? You should believe in yourself and in your future.
